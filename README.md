# rest
Learn to code a REST API in different languages (python, go, rust).

This is a simple REST API implemented in different languages. This is not a benchmark, it's educational. But feel free to perform a benchmark. 
The purpose of this project is to make a tour of the different framworks (actix-web, fiber, flask/gunicorn) and how to deploy them on Debian with Nginx and systemd (todo). This is DevOps. 

In each folder, you will find a Readme to build and launch them locally or in production (todo).
